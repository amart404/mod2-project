    <div class="about">
        <p>This is Andrew and Aaron's module 2 project for Flatiron School. It is a simple game recommendation service that uses an API that originally has 300,000+ titles
            We used a loop and http/net params to slim the data down to 50 titles as this API was formatted in such a way in which we could not make more than a certain amount of requests per second.
            Aaron wrestled with the API for about two days until we were finally able to attain a usable dataset, meanwhile Andrew designed the front end. As of Wednesday (midway through the week),
            the search function does not currently work. We are in the process of creating the JS functions in order to recieve the correct games based on the parameters (genre, platform, and an optional name field).
            This project has proved to be harder in someways, yet overall a lot easier and smoother as a process. This is the last duo project of the program and mods 3, 4, and 5 are all solo.
